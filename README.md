# Zap Language

Basic editor support for [Zap](https://zap.redblox.dev), providing syntax highlighting, indentation, and code folding.

Grammar implementations are pulled from two separate repositories:

- VSCode uses the [TextMate](https://github.com/filiptibell/tmlanguage-zap) grammar.
- Zed uses the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/filiptibell/tree-sitter-zap) grammar.

Please report issues with syntax and/or highlighting to their corresponding repositories linked above.
